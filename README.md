Launching a Meal Suggestion App called "MYMEAL! SUGGESTOR " that helps users get food recommendations based on different times of day. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and functionality:
User enters a time of day type and the app suggests appropriate food and display an image.

User can:
Get new suggestions by entering different times.
Reset everything to start fresh.

Target Users:
Those struggling with meal planning./
Individuals looking for quick food ideas...

This appears designed as a simple but effective tool for helping users overcome "food decision fatigue" by providing  quick time-appropriate meal Suggestions.


THE SCREENSHOTS OF THE APP CAN BE FOUND ABOVE IN THE MAIN BRANCH AS SCREENSHOTS.
Nice project!
